KetchUp is a tool for scheduling meetings. The main features of the application including storing user’s calendar information
and allowing the user to schedule a meeting location based on the user’s geolocation to the closest Starbucks.

The technologies used include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, environmental 
variables, hashing and encryption, EJS, Heroku, Google Maps API, Git and GitHub. I contributed to the project with the 
following: the appointment scheduling page, including the Google Maps API call and connection to the PostgreSQL database, 
templates for index.js Express routes, wireframes and all styling, and calendar jQuery plugin.
